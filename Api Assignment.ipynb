    "Ans :- Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It offers products or services to communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, are some reason for using API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Programming Interface acronym API helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other.\n",
    "It helps you to embed content from any site or application more efficiently.\n",
    "APIs can access app components. The delivery of services and information is more flexible.\n",
    "Content generated can be published automatically.\n",
    "It allows the user or a company to customize the content and services which they use the most.\n",
    "Software needs to change over time, and APIs help to anticipate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of API\n",
    "Here are some important features of API:\n",
    "\n",
    "It offers a valuable service (data, function, audience,.).\n",
    "It helps you to plan a business model.\n",
    "Simple, flexible, quickly adopted.\n",
    "Managed and measured.\n",
    "Offers great developer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of API\n",
    "There are mainly four main types of APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open APIs: These types of APIs are publicly available to use like OAuth APIs from Google. It has also not given any restriction to use them. So, they are also known as Public APIs.\n",
    "Partner APIs: Specific rights or licenses to access this type of API because they are not available to the public.\n",
    "Internal APIs: Internal or private. These APIs are developed by companies to use in their internal systems. It helps you to enhance the productivity of your teams.\n",
    "Composite APIs: This type of API combines different data and service APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication level of APIs:\n",
    "Here, are some communication level of APIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Level APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level APIs are those that we can generally use in REST form, where programmers have a high level of abstraction. These API’s mostly concerned about performing a limited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-Level APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of APIs has a lower level of abstraction, which means they are more detailed. It allows the programmer to manipulate functions within an application module or hardware at a granular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the functionality of the API, let see the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let see how API works using simple daily life example. Imagine that you went to a restaurant to take lunch or dinner. The waiter comes to you gives you a menu card, and you will provide personalize it order like you want a veg sandwich but without onion.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, you will get your order from the waiter. However, it is not that simple as it looks as there is some process that happens in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the waiter plays an important part as you will neither go to the kitchen to collect your order nor will you tell the kitchen staff what you want all this done by the waiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "API also does the same by taking your request, and just like the waiter tell the system what you want and give a response back to you."

    "Ans :- some common advantages of using API :-\n",
    "Efficiency\n",
    "Providing API access allows for content to be created once and automatically published or made available to many channels. Your agency’s content is ready for easy sharing and redistribution to deliver your mission directly to more citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wider Reach\n",
    "By allowing anyone to create a new presentation layer—like an app, a website, or a widget—APIs can be used to distribute services and information to new audiences and in specific contexts that can be customized to provide tailored user experiences. People who do not come to your website can get agency information or services from apps or other websites that they regularly visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation\n",
    "APIs allow machines to handle the workload, which would otherwise require the manual work of a human. This can be as simple as having one content update propagate to multiple sections of a site (or multiple websites) at once. More broadly, though, APIs enable not just your team but also your agency to update workflows so that they can be done with fewer steps and greater productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration\n",
    "APIs allow your content to be more easily embedded or interwoven throughout your sites or other applications. Thus, you can ensure a smooth and integrated user experience, and relevant and up-to-date information, for the user. The information is delivered wherever it can be useful to them, not just in those places where your team has had time to update the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personalized Content\n",
    "API enables businesses to get a clear understanding of the tastes and preferences of the customer. This allows businesses to make personalized recommendations and generate better customer leads and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud Prevention \n",
    "API has various levels of security depending upon the type of API that you use which ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the data generated using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Competency\n",
    "The information that is transmitted from one system to another is quickly intercepted and interpreted by API. This level of efficiency ensures information automatically available to every platform which leads to quicker and improved decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptability\n",
    "API can anticipate changes in terms of needs that arise in the due course of business. It used the technology at its disposal to analyze the information present within the system more closely and thus makes the service provisions more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Disadvantages of using API :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Security Risks\n",
    "When using an API web-server interface, businesses are exposing their data to potential security risks. This is because the API is essentially a bridge between the business and the web server, and any malicious actors could potentially gain access to the data. To mitigate this risk, businesses should ensure that they are using a secure API web-server interface, and that they are taking the necessary steps to protect their data. This includes using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and other security measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialized Knowledge\n",
    "Using an API web-server interface requires specialized knowledge. This is because the API is essentially a programming language, and businesses need to understand how to use it in order to access and manage their data. This means that businesses need to either hire someone with the necessary knowledge, or they need to invest in training their existing staff. This can be a costly endeavor, and it is something that businesses should consider before deciding to use an API web-server interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility Issues\n",
    "Another potential disadvantage of using an API web-server interface is the potential for compatibility issues. This is because the API is essentially a bridge between the business and the web server, and if the two are not compatible, then the data may not be able to be accessed or managed properly. To mitigate this risk, businesses should ensure that they are using an API web-server interface that is compatible with their web server. This can be done by researching the API and the web server to ensure that they are compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Costs\n",
    "Using an API web-server interface can also be costly. This is because businesses need to invest in the necessary hardware and software in order to use the API. This includes the cost of the API itself, as well as the cost of any additional hardware or software that may be needed. Additionally, businesses may need to invest in training their staff in order to use the API properly. This can be a significant cost, and businesses should consider this before deciding to use an API web-server interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintenance\n",
    "Using an API web-server interface also requires ongoing maintenance. This is because the API needs to be regularly updated in order to ensure that it is secure and compatible with the web server. Additionally, businesses need to ensure that their staff are properly trained in order to use the API properly. This can be a time-consuming and costly endeavor, and businesses should consider this before deciding to use an API web-server interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-Consuming\n",
    "Using an API web-server interface can also be time-consuming. This is because businesses need to invest time in researching the API and the web server to ensure that they are compatible. Additionally, businesses need to invest time in training their staff in order to use the API properly. This can be a significant time investment, and businesses should consider this before deciding to use an API web-server interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "Finally, using an API web-server interface can also have some limitations. This is because the API is essentially a bridge between the business and the web server, and it may not be able to access or manage certain types of data. Additionally, the API may not be able to access certain features of the web server. To mitigate this risk, businesses should research the API and the web server to ensure that they are compatible and that they can access and manage the data that they need.\n"

    "Ans :- REST: representational state transfer :-\n",
    "REST is a set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications. Because it's a set of guidelines, it leaves the implementation of these recommendations to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a request for data is sent to a REST API, it’s usually done through hypertext transfer protocol (commonly referred to as HTTP). Once a request is received, APIs designed for REST (called RESTful APIs or RESTful web services) can return messages in a variety of formats: HTML, XML, plain text, and JSON. JSON (JavaScript object notation) is favored as a message format because it can be read by any programming language (despite the name), is human- and machine-readable, and is lightweight. In this way, RESTful APIs are more flexible and can be easier to set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "An application is said to be RESTful if it follows 6 architectural guidelines. A RESTful application must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client-server architecture composed of clients, servers, and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client content is stored on the server between requests. Information about the session’s state is instead held with the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cacheable data to eliminate the need for some client-server interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standardized form instead of specific to an application’s needs. This is described by Roy Fielding, the originator of REST, as “the central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based styles.”\n",
    "\n",
    "5.A layered system constraint, where client-server interactions can be mediated by hierarchical layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Code on demand, allowing servers to extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (though also reducing visibility, making this an optional guideline).\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP: simple object access protocol :-\n",
    "SOAP is a standard protocol that was first designed so that applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate. Because it is a protocol, it imposes built-in rules that increase its complexity and overhead, which can lead to longer page load times. However, these standards also offer built-in compliances that can make it preferable for enterprise scenarios. The built-in compliance standards include security, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), which is a set of properties for ensuring reliable database transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common web service specifications include\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Web services security (WS-security): Standardizes how messages are secured and transferred through unique identifiers called tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)WS-ReliableMessaging: Standardizes error handling between messages transferred across unreliable IT infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Web services addressing (WS-addressing): Packages routing information as metadata within SOAP headers, instead of maintaining such information deeper within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Web services description language (WSDL): Describes what a web service does, and where that service begins and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a request for data is sent to a SOAP API, it can be handled through any of the application layer protocols: HTTP (for web browsers), SMTP (for email), TCP, and others. However, once a request is received, return SOAP messages must be returned as XML documents—a markup language that is both human- and machine-readable. A completed request to a SOAP API is not cacheable by a browser, so it cannot be accessed later without resending to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "some shortcomings of soap architecture are :-\n",
    "1)Highly complex\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to Rest, SOAP is significantly more complex. It's also less flexible. This might present a challenge for developers that are not highly skilled. The extensive processing required may also slow down performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)No variety of data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is also extremely limited in its support of data formats. The formats supported by Rest include HTML, JSON, YAML, XML and others. Meanwhile, SOAP only supports XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)API calls are not cached\n",
    "\n",
    "The process where a request is sent after an API is set up with the correct endpoints is referred to as an API call. The process results in the information being transferred, processed and feedback being provided. It's not possible for SOAP API calls to be cached.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Uses more bandwidth\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is generally slower in comparison to Rest and it also uses more bandwidth given its very complex nature. It’s another limiting factor in the efficacy of this technology for certain projects."
